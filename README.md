for single step reaction use `run_one.sh` and for multistep use `run_multi.sh`. All the arguments provided in those files are used to get our main trained model. Modify accordingly to train your datasets. You can use `rand_run.py` with our default running seed values to get the trained models to reproduce the result.
```
python rand_run.py gpu_id
```
For example, `python rand_run.py 0`.
